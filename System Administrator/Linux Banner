[This beginner level task becomes confusing/hard if not executed in proper way. Follow below steps to make it successful]

[---STEP 1---]
[Open total 4 terminals for better understanding.Then enter below command in individual termials]


{Terminal 1 / App Server 1}
sudo scp -r nautilus_banner tony@stapp01:/home/tony                 --------->Here, I entered /home in command as per question (template location) you can update it as per your question eg. /tmp

{Terminal 2 / App Server 2}
sudo scp -r nautilus_banner steve@stapp02:/home/steve

{Terminal 3 / App Server 3}
sudo scp -r nautilus_banner banner@stapp03:/home/banner

ssh -t tony@stapp01 'sudo mv /tmp/nautilus_banner /etc/motd'
pass

scp -r /home/thor/nautilus_banner peter@stdb01:/tmp
