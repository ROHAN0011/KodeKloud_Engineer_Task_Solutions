[As per question there is one faulty app host so for finding that run below command on jump_host]

telnet stapp01 <given apache port>
telnet stapp02
telnet stapp03


[The one which is refusing to connect is the faulty one. So, login and swith to root on that app server. Then run below commands]

systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd              ----->(status will inactive/failed)

netstat -tulnp                      ----->remember or note the PID of 'sendmail:accep'  it will visible in the format of PID/sendmail:accep   e.g 618/sendmail:accep   here, 618 is my PID

ps -ef |grep sendmail

kill <PID>

ps -ef |grep sendmail

systemctl start httpd
systemctl status httpd

[For validating check on jumphost]
telnet <faulty appserver e.g stapp01> <given apache port>
